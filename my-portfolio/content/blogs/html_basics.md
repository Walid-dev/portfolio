## Introduction

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of web content, enabling browsers to render text, images, and other materials on the web. This article aims to demystify HTML, breaking down its core concepts, elements, and functionalities.

## Core Concepts

### What is HTML?

HTML uses tags to annotate text, images, and other content for web browsers. It is the skeleton of all web pages and is crucial for web development.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document

Every HTML document follows a specific structure, beginning with a document type declaration, followed by the `<html>` element, which encloses the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

{{< highlight html >}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
{{< /highlight >}}

### Key HTML Tags

- **`<html>`**: The root element of an HTML page
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document
- **`<title>`**: Specifies a title for the document
- **`<body>`**: Contains the visible page content
- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`**: Header tags
- **`<p>`**: Paragraph tag

## Code Examples

### Creating a Simple Web Page

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple web page using basic HTML tags.

{{< highlight html >}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
{{< /highlight >}}

### Incorporating Images and Links

HTML allows you to incorporate images and create links using the `<img>` and `<a>` tags, respectively.

{{< highlight html >}}
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of Image">
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
{{< /highlight >}}
