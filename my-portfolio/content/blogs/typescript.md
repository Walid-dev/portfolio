## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft, introduces static typing to the language. It aims to make development on large JavaScript projects more manageable and less error-prone.

## Core Concepts of TypeScript

TypeScript's static typing allows developers to define the types of their variables, functions, and objects. This addition brings significant advantages:

- **Early Error Detection**: Errors can be caught at compile time.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Types make the code easier to read and maintain.

### Basic Type Annotations

Define variable types directly in the code:

{{< highlight ts >}}
let userName: string = 'John Doe';
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
let userAge: number = 30;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of objects, making code more predictable:

{{< highlight ts >}}
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

const user: User = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  age: 28,
  isAdmin: false
};
{{< /highlight >}}

### Classes and Inheritance

TypeScript enhances OOP with classes, interfaces, and inheritance:

{{< highlight ts >}}
class Person {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
  constructor(name: string, employeeId: number) {
    super(name);
    this.employeeId = employeeId;
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

## TypeScript in Modern Web Development

Integrating with frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue, TypeScript enhances development with static typing and object-oriented features.

## Conclusion

TypeScript has reshaped JavaScript development by providing a suite of tools for creating more reliable and maintainable applications. Its ongoing evolution and adoption by the community underscore its value in modern web development.
