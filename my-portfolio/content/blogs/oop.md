## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

### Core Principles of OOP

OOP is built around four main principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These principles help developers create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods. This protects the integrity of the object's state from unintended modifications.

```java
public class Animal {
  private String name;

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

#### Abstraction

Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void makeSound();
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Bark");
  }
}
```

#### Inheritance

Inheritance allows classes to inherit features (methods and properties) from other classes. This promotes code reuse and a hierarchical classification.

```java
public class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
  }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("The dog barks.");
  }
}
```

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

```java
public class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Some sound");
  }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Bark");
  }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Meow");
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming offers a structured approach to software development. It enables developers to build applications with reusable and maintainable code, leading to efficient development processes and scalable software architecture.
