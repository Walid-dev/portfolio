      <description>Redux: Simplifying State Management Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with libraries like React, Angular, and Vue. It helps manage the state of an application in a single global object, making state mutations predictable through a strict contract of actions and reducers.&#xA;Why Redux?
