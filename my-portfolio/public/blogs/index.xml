      <guid>http://localhost:63827/blogs/oop-polymorphism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Polymorphism, a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It&amp;rsquo;s a principle that enhances flexibility and modularity in software development.&#xA;Understanding Polymorphism Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, despite sharing the same name. This capability is crucial for implementing interface-based programming and method overriding.&#xA;Non-Technical Example Consider a simple action like &amp;lsquo;drawing.</description>

      <title>Composition in React: Building Flexible Components</title>
      <link>http://localhost:63827/blogs/react_composition/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:63827/blogs/react_composition/</guid>
      <description>Embracing Composition in React Composition is a core concept in React that promotes building components by composing smaller, reusable pieces. Unlike inheritance, composition provides a more flexible way to build up UIs by utilizing a &amp;ldquo;has-a&amp;rdquo; rather than an &amp;ldquo;is-a&amp;rdquo; relationship between components.&#xA;Why Composition? Composition allows developers to create components that encapsulate behavior and UI elements, which can then be composed together to form more complex UIs. This model encourages code reuse and simplifies the maintenance of large applications.</description>
